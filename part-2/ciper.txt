Logic: 

For this cipher I will be attempting to make a keyed cipher. This cipher will place all the letters and numbers into one large array with each character taking 1 index of the array. I will be including Capital letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. This base array will be the index for the Key. The key will be stored in a variable that is also inside of another array. Upon recieving a message the program will find the messages corresponding character within the index array and calculate the difference in value between the respective indexes of both the message character the character in the key. The key will continually repeat itself until each character of the message has been given a numerical value. That numerical value will then be ciphered into another array containing all of the characters from the first array in a different order. The second array's order will be determined by a second private key which will operate similar to the first only rather than encoding a message it will only encode the array the numerical values assigned by the public key of the message is being sent through to the server

The server will then be able to decipher the correct numbers, and then will be able to determine the message through the first
